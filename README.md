# DoomLauncher
Early version of launcher for DOOM (1993) for speedrunning purposes.

This version allows to choose Doom's WAD file, directory of <a href ="https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Crispy_Doom">crisp-doom.exe</a> (also works with <a href="https://www.chocolate-doom.org/wiki/index.php/Chocolate_Doom">chocolate-doom.exe</a>) and config file for Doom (usually default.cfg in crisp doom folder).
This program allows to choose chapters from DOOM1, NoMonster mode and demo recording (actually in crisp/chocolate doom's folder there must be folder called Demos for demo recording to work properly)
